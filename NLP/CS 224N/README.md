# CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

## Introduction

This is the notes taken from Stanford CS224n, combining my own collected notes

Assignments I completed for each lecture are included below

### What is this course about?

Natural language processing (NLP) or computational linguistics is one of the most important technologies of the information age. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, politics, etc. In the last decade, deep learning (or neural network) approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. 

All the assignments will be done in **Pytorch**
